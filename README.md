# machinelearning_with_riotapi
What is this?
I created a Deep Learning model that generates random user names. 

On which dataset has the model been trained?
I used Riot's API to download more than 60000 summoners names (ingame names), all across
their global servers. I filtered non-ascii names out and created a database which is 
basically a huge text file that contains 1 name per line
